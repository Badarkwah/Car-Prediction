# Cars4U: Used Car Price Prediction 🚗💲

## Project Overview 📈
In the burgeoning Indian market, the surge in demand for used cars has outpaced new car sales, presenting a unique opportunity for Cars4U, a forward-thinking tech start-up. This project is dedicated to developing a robust predictive model to accurately determine used car prices, empowering Cars4U to refine their pricing strategies for maximum profitability.

## Objectives 🎯
- Conduct a thorough exploration and visualization of the dataset to uncover trends within the used car market.
- Develop a linear regression model capable of predicting used car prices with high accuracy.
- Provide a series of insights and actionable recommendations to guide Cars4U in refining their marketing and pricing strategies.

## Data Insights 📊
The project delves into a rich dataset detailing various attributes of used cars sold across numerous locations. Attributes analyzed include the car's brand and model, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, and more, providing a comprehensive overview of factors influencing used car pricing.

## Data Dictionary 📚
- **S.No.**: Serial number
- **Name**: Name of the car, including brand and model
- **Location**: The city where the car is available for purchase
- **Year**: Year of manufacture
- **Kilometers_driven**: Total distance the car has been driven
- **Fuel_Type**: Type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric)
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission (Automatic/Manual)
- **Owner**: Ownership category
- **Mileage**: Fuel efficiency
- **Engine**: Engine capacity in CC
- **Power**: Engine power in bhp
- **Seats**: Number of seats in the car
- **New_Price**: Price of a new car of the same model
- **Price**: Selling price of the used car

## Methodology 🛠️
This project employs a rigorous approach, starting from data preprocessing and exploration, moving on to the construction and training of a linear regression model, and culminating in the model's evaluation. The process ensures the development of a reliable model for predicting used car prices.

## Findings & Recommendations 💡
Analysis of the dataset reveals critical factors that significantly impact the pricing of used cars, such as the car's make, age, mileage, engine power, and more. Based on these findings, we recommend targeted marketing strategies and differential pricing models to enhance Cars4U's market presence and profitability.

## How to Use 🚀
1. **Prepare the Data**: Follow the preprocessing steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook to ready the dataset for modeling.
2. **Build the Model**: Utilize the dataset to train the linear regression model detailed in the notebook.
3. **Evaluate and Implement**: Assess the model's performance and apply the insights generated to inform strategic business decisions.
